# Me :v:
I’m @RiMillo (Riccardo M.), hi y'all! :wave: I'm :it: and :fr:, currently based in Paris.

## Resumes
For a full formal presentation, have a look at my resume:

* English :uk: [here](./CV_ENG.pdf)
* Italiano :it: [qui](./CV_ITA.pdf)
* Français :fr: [par ici](./CV_FRA.pdf)

## What I do
I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics (Numerical Analysis for Fluid Dynamics) from CERMICS (ENPC, France :fr:) and EDF. I am an alumnus of Politecnico di Milano :it: (Ingegneria Matematica) and Ecole polytechnique :fr:. I am currently a Post-Doc fellow at CEREA (ENPC, France :fr:) and part of the Sciences^2024 program which uses physics and mathematics to give a scientific characterization of some sports and help athletes in their training on the road towards Paris 2024 Olympic Games. With my team, we are focusing on archery: find the best arrow for a given atmospheric setting.

## What makes me dream
As you guessed, I'm passionate about Mathematics and sports and I hope to make a job out of this. I have a special interest for Fluid Dynamics and my dream is to work in a team responsible for the design of a F1 race car :red_car::checkered_flag: or a sailboat :sailboat:.

## What I can do
I have a Engineering background (BSc and 2x MSc) with two main axes: mathematics and computer sciences. I like coding. My language of predilection is `C/C++` which I used in numerous scientific projects and for my PhD. I try to learn new stuff every day, currently exploring `python` and `GO`. I have heard all the best about `Rust` and I plan to have a look at it, too. FYI, I like `LaTeX`, too.

## What I would like to do
I have already told you about [my dream jobs](#what_makes_me_dream). I'd like to work in the research and development branch of a company as developer of a scientific tool / software.
