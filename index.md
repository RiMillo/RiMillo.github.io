# Who I am :v:
Hi y'all! :wave:

I'm Riccardo.
I'm :it: and :fr:, currently based in Paris.

For a detailed _formal_ presentation, have a look at my resume:

* English :uk: [here](./data/CV_ENG.pdf)
* Italiano :it: [qui](./data/CV_ITA.pdf)
* Français :fr: [par ici](./data/CV_FRA.pdf)

# What I do
I am a research engineer at [ONERA](https://onera.fr), the French aerospace lab.
The topic of my work is numerical methods for the CFD.

My research focuses around novel numerical schemes, especially robust and stable [DG methods](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113254).
I'm also interested at how AI can be applied to numerical methods and, more generally, to CFD.
I advise PhD students and interns on the related topics.

I take part in the development of [CODA](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2023-3275), the next generation CFD solver shared by ONERA, DLR, and Airbus.
I also develop other small software, such as [CoMMA](https://github.com/onera/CoMMA), an agglomerator of which I am the main developer.

</div>

More generally, my work concerns the full spectrum of scientific computing: devising numerical schemes, developing solvers (parallel solvers, _ça va sans dire_), optimize performance, and managing installations on computing clusters (`spack` anyone?).

# What I did
I have obtained two MSc in Engineering/Applied Mathematics from of Politecnico di Milano :it: (Ingegneria Matematica) and École polytechnique :fr:.
I have a [PhD](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03080530) in Applied Mathematics (Numerical Analysis for Fluid Dynamics) from CERMICS (ENPC, France :fr:) and EDF.

I was a Post-Doc research fellow at CEREA (ENPC, France :fr:) and part of the Sciences^2024 program which uses physics and mathematics to give a scientific characterization of some sports and helps athletes in their training on the road towards Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
Our focus was archery: find the best arrow for a given atmospheric setting.

# What I can do
I have an engineering background (BSc and 2x MSc) with two main axes: mathematics and computer sciences.
I like coding.
My language of predilection is `C/C++` which I used in numerous scientific projects and for my PhD (hybrid parallelism `MPI x OMP` included).

For light scripting I resort to `python`.
I have use it for several projects in various topics such as statistical analysis, computer vision, heavy spreadsheet manipulation, and ML.

I have heard all the best about `Rust` and I am very curious about GPU-programming: they are on my TODO list, I plan to have a look at them soon!

FYI, I like `LaTeX`, too: [spoiler alert: self promotion] checkout this [`GitHub` repo](https://github.com/RiMillo/LaTeX_tips) about `LaTeX` Tips&Tricks.

# What makes me dream
As you guessed, I'm passionate about mathematics and sports and I hope to make a job out of this.
I have a special interest for fluid dynamics and my dream is to work in a team responsible for the design of a F1 race car :red_car::checkered_flag: or a sailboat :sailboat:.

# What I would like to do
I'd like to work in the research and development branch of a company as developer of a scientific tool / software.
The applications in which I would like to be involved are fluid dynamics and anything that is bio-related or health-driven (e.g., _in silico_ conception of new pharmaceutical drugs,...): combining all the three (e.g., hemodynamics) would be just great!

# What I do (outside work)
My hobbies come and go.
One thing is always there: sport, be it practiced or watched.

I already talked about F1, did I?
I've played basketball :basketball: several years and, although I do not practice it anymore, it is still my favorite sport.
I have taken up (road) running.
I have run 2 marathons: Paris marathon in 2019 and the Paris 2024 Olympic Games marathon (OK, not _that_ one, but _le Marathon pour tous_, still).
My PR is 3h23.
I have to admit that I'm not always training as for a marathon, there are indeed some _lazy_ periods.

I like to read SciFi and dystopian novels, especially where science is mixed in.
Some authors that I loved are Terry Pratchett (the Discworld series), Isaac Asimov (the Foundation series), China Miéville (I really appreciated "Kraken"), and Neal Stephenson ("Anathem" and "Seveneves").
But let us not forget J.R.R. Tolkien, please!

Otherwise, I'm always up for coding side-projects which can help me getting better and teach me new programming languages.

# What about a chat?
Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milanir/)!
Otherwise, my contact details are in the resume.
